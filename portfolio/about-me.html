    <br>
    I'm Haley, a bipolar individual with a serious passion for video games. 
    <br>
    <br>
    From my early days, gaming has been my go-to source of entertainment and escape. Speaking of which, The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker holds a special place in my heart for its captivating storyline and unique art style.

    When I'm not conquering virtual realms, I'm a proud parent of two amazing human children and a mini zoo full of adorable fur babies. It's like living in a cute and chaotic paradise, with my furry companions bringing endless joy and laughter to my everyday life.
    
    Beyond my love for gaming and my zoo crew, I also have a deep appreciation for anime. The vibrant worlds, compelling narratives, and diverse characters never fail to captivate my imagination. Anime is my ultimate source of inspiration and a fantastic way to unwind after a long day.
    
    On the professional front, I've ventured into different domains, starting as a talented hair stylist, where I expressed my creativity through trendy hairstyles. I then explored the medical field as a skilled phlebotomist, honing my precision and care for others. Currently, I'm on an exciting journey as an aspiring web developer, striving to expand my knowledge and skills in the ever-evolving digital world. I'm self-driven and determined to carve my path in the realm of web development.

    Join me on this adventure as I navigate the world of web development, share gaming anecdotes, express my love for anime, and celebrate the joy of having a mini zoo as part of my family. It's a casual yet professional ride, filled with exciting experiences, personal growth, and a whole lot of cuteness. Let's embark on this journey together and see where it takes us!
